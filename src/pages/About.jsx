        <p className="text-lg">
          I have been interested in pursuing a career in computer science since I learned to code in 
	  elementary school. This was later solidified during my career exploration with engineering 
	  and computer science classes in high school. Throughout my time thus far at GVSU, I have 
	  enjoyed learning different aspects of the computer science field. During the summer of 2025,
	  I interned with Galileo Insights, where I was testing code and working on various projects. 
	  I enjoyed QA testing for the application the company was working on. I also enjoyed helping 
	  them incorporate Playright testing, and their SRE role for their company.
